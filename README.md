# 🔋 Atomic Fuel

>[!IMPORTANT] 
> This project is now maintained as part of [this repository](https://github.com/atomicjolt/atomic-libs)

This package contains all of the front-end library code for Atomic Jolt apps. It includes all front-end code that was previously in the `client/libs` directory.

## 🧱 Installation
You should install atomic fuel into each individual app not in the client directory. Just add as a regular dependency.

`yarn add atomic-fuel`

## 🧑‍🔬 Usage
All of the code is found in the libs folder which has the following structure
```
libs/
-- actions
-- api
-- communications
-- components
-- constants
-- decorators
-- graphql
-- libs
-- loaders
-- middleware
-- reducers
-- specs_support
-- store
```
If you wanted to use, for example, `libs/store/configure_store.js` you would write the following:
```Javascript
import configureStore from 'atomic-fuel/libs/configure_store.js';
```
Alternatively, there is an index file which simply exports everything for
convenience, so you can do this:
```Javascript
import { configureStore } from 'atomic-fuel';
```

### 🚧 Building
To build the lib folders and types run:
`yarn build`
### 🧪 Testing
Run tests:
`yarn test`

Run tests with Chrome DevTools (i.e. use debugger in your tests):
1. Open a Chromium browser at `chrome://inspect`
2. Click on the "Open dedicated DevTools for Node"

Then you can run tests using:
`yarn test:debug`
